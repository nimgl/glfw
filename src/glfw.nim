  ## This function sets the close callback of the specified window, which is called when the user attempts to close the
  ## window, for example by clicking the close widget in the title bar.
  ## The close flag is set before this callback is called, but you can modify it at any time with glfwSetWindowShouldClose.
  ## The close callback is not triggered by glfwDestroyWindow.
  ## Returns The previously set callback, or nil if no callback was set or an error occurred.

proc setWindowRefreshCallback*(window: GLFWWindow, `proc`: glfwWindowRefreshProc): glfwWindowRefreshProc {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetWindowRefreshCallback".}
  ## This function sets the refresh callback of the specified window, which is called when the client area of the window
  ## needs to be redrawn, for example if the window has been exposed after having been covered by another window.
  ## On compositing window systems such as Aero, Compiz or Aqua, where the window contents are saved off-screen, this
  ## callback may be called only very infrequently or never at all.
  ## Returns The previously set callback, or nil if no callback was set or an error occurred.

proc setWindowFocusCallback*(window: GLFWWindow, `proc`: glfwWindowFocusProc): glfwWindowFocusProc {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetWindowFocusCallback".}
  ## This function sets the focus callback of the specified window, which is called when the window gains or loses input focus.
  ## After the focus callback is called for a window that lost input focus, synthetic key and mouse button release events
  ## will be generated for all such that had been pressed. For more information, see glfwSetKeyCallback and glfwSetMouseButtonCallback.
  ## Returns The previously set callback, or nil if no callback was set or an error occurred.

proc setWindowIconifyCallback*(window: GLFWWindow, `proc`: glfwWindowIconifyProc): glfwWindowIconifyProc {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetWindowIconifyCallback".}
  ## This function sets the iconification callback of the specified window, which is called when the window is iconified or restored.
  ## Returns The previously set callback, or nil if no callback was set or an error occurred.

proc setFramebufferSizeCallback*(window: GLFWWindow, `proc`: glfwFramebufferSizeProc): glfwFramebufferSizeProc {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback".}
  ## This function sets the framebuffer resize callback of the specified window, which is called when the framebuffer
  ## of the specified window is resized.
  ## Returns The previously set callback, or nil if no callback was set or an error occurred.

proc setCursorPos*(window: GLFWWindow, xpos: float64, ypos: float64): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetCursorPos".}
  ## This function sets the position, in screen coordinates, of the cursor relative to the upper-left corner of the client
  ## area of the specified window. The window must have input focus. If the window does not have input focus when this
  ## function is called, it fails silently.
  ## Do not use this function to implement things like camera controls. GLFW already provides the GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED
  ## cursor mode that hides the cursor, transparently re-centers it and provides unconstrained cursor motion.
  ## See glfwSetInputMode for more information.

proc getInputMode*(window: GLFWWindow, mode: int32): int32 {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetInputMode".}
  ## This function returns the value of an input option for the specified
  ## window. The mode must be one of EGLFW_CURSOR,
  ## GLFW_STICKY_KEYS or GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS.

proc setInputMode*(window: GLFWWindow, mode: int32, value: int32): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetInputMode".}
  ## This function sets an input mode option for the specified window. The mode
  ## must be one of #GLFW_CURSOR,
  ## GLFW_STICKY_KEYS or GLFW_STICKY_MOUSE_BUTTONS.

proc setCursor*(window: GLFWWindow, cursor: GLFWCursor): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetCursor".}
  ## This function sets the cursor image to be used when the cursor is over the
  ## client area of the specified window.
  ## The set cursor will only be visible when the cursor mode of the window is
  ## GLFW_CURSOR_NORMAL.
  ##On some platforms, the set cursor may not be visible unless the window also
  ##has input focus.

proc getMonitorPos*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, xpos: var int32, ypos: var int32): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetMonitorPos".}
  ## This function returns the position, in screen coordinates, of the
  ## upper-left corner of the specified monitor.
  ##
  ## Any or all of the position arguments may be NULL. If an error occurs, all
  ## non-NULL position arguments will be set to zero.

proc getMonitorWorkarea*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, xpos: var int32, ypos: var int32, width: var int32, height: var int32): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetMonitorWorkarea".}
  ## This function returns the position, in screen coordinates, of the
  ## upper-left corner of the work area of the specified monitor along with the
  ## work area size in screen coordinates. The work area is defined as the area
  ## of the monitor not occluded by the operating system task bar where present.
  ## If no task bar exists then the work area is the monitor resolution in
  ## screen coordinates.
  ##
  ## Any or all of the position and size arguments may be NULL. If an error
  ## occurs, all non-NULL position and size arguments will be set to zero.

proc getMonitorPhysicalSize*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, widthMM: var int32, heightMM: var int32): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetMonitorPhysicalSize".}
  ## This function returns the size, in millimetres, of the display area of the
  ## specified monitor.
  ##
  ## Some systems do not provide accurate monitor size information, either
  ## because the monitor EDID data is incorrect or because the driver does not
  ## report it accurately.
  ##
  ## Any or all of the size arguments may be NULL. If an error occurs, all
  ## non-NULL size arguments will be set to zero.

proc getMonitorContentScale*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, xscale: var float32, yscale: var float32): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetMonitorContentScale".}
  ## This function retrieves the content scale for the specified monitor. The
  ## content scale is the ratio between the current DPI and the platform's
  ## default DPI. This is especially important for text and any UI elements. If
  ## the pixel dimensions of your UI scaled by this look appropriate on your
  ## machine then it should appear at a reasonable size on other machines
  ## regardless of their DPI and scaling settings. This relies on the system DPI
  ## and scaling settings being somewhat correct.
  ##
  ## The content scale may depend on both the monitor resolution and pixel
  ## density and on user settings. It may be very different from the raw DPI
  ## calculated from the physical size and current resolution.

proc getMonitorName*(monitor: GLFWMonitor): cstring {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetMonitorName".}
  ## This function returns a human-readable name, encoded as UTF-8, of the
  ## specified monitor. The name typically reflects the make and model of the
  ## monitor and is not guaranteed to be unique among the connected monitors.

proc setMonitorUserPointer*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, `ptr`: pointer): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetMonitorUserPointer".}
  ## This function sets the user-defined pointer of the specified monitor.
  ## The current value is retained until the monitor is disconnected.
  ## The initial value is ``nil``.
  ##
  ## This function may be called from the monitor callback, even for a monitor
  ## that is being disconnected.

proc getMonitorUserPointer*(monitor: GLFWMonitor): pointer {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetMonitorUserPointer".}
  ## This function returns the current value of the user-defined pointer of the
  ## specified monitor. The initial value is ``nil``.
  ##
  ## This function may be called from the monitor callback, even for a monitor
  ## that is being disconnected.

proc setMonitorCallback*(`proc`: glfwMonitorProc): glfwMonitorProc {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetMonitorCallback".}
  ## This function sets the monitor configuration callback, or removes the
  ## currently set callback. This is called when a monitor is connected to or
  ## disconnected from the system.

proc getVidModes*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, count: var int32): ptr UncheckedArray[GLFWVidMode] {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetVideoModes".}
  ## This function returns an array of all video modes supported by the
  ## specified monitor. The returned array is sorted in ascending order, first
  ## by color bit depth (the sum of all channel depths) and then by resolution
  ## area (the product of width and height).

proc getVidMode*(monitor: GLFWMonitor): GLFWVidMode {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetVideoMode".}
  ## This function returns the current video mode of the specified monitor. If
  ## you have created a full screen window for that monitor, the return value
  ## will depend on whether that window is iconified.

proc setGamma*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, gamma: float32): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetGamma".}
  ## This function generates an appropriately sized gamma ramp from the
  ## specified exponent and then calls glfwSetGammaRamp with it. The value must
  ## be a finite number greater than zero.
  ##
  ## The software controlled gamma ramp is applied in addition to the hardware
  ## gamma correction, which today is usually an approximation of sRGB gamma.
  ## This means that setting a perfectly linear ramp, or gamma 1.0, will produce
  ## the default (usually sRGB-like) behavior.
  ##
  ## For gamma correct rendering with OpenGL or OpenGL ES, see the
  ## GLFW_SRGB_CAPABLE hint.

proc getGammaRamp*(monitor: GLFWMonitor): ptr GLFWGammaRamp {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetGammaRamp".}
  ## This function returns the current gamma ramp of the specified monitor.

proc setGammaRamp*(monitor: GLFWMonitor, ramp: ptr GLFWGammaRamp): void {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwSetGammaRamp".}
  ## This function sets the current gamma ramp for the specified monitor.
  ## The original gamma ramp for that monitor is saved by GLFW the first time
  ## this function is called and is restored by glfwTerminate.
  ##

when defined(windows):
  proc getWin32Window*(window: GLFWWindow): pointer {.glfw_lib, importc: "glfwGetWin32Window".}
    ## returns The ``HWND`` of the specified window, or ``nil`` if an error occurred.
else:
  proc getWin32Window*(window: GLFWWindow): pointer = nil
    ## if you are not working in windows this returns a nil so you can still use it
