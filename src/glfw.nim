    ## but re-arranged to map to 7-bit ASCII for printable keys (function keys are
    ## put in the 256+ range).
    ##
    ## The naming of the key codes follow these rules:
    ##  - The US keyboard layout is used
    ##  - Names of printable alpha-numeric characters are used (e.g. "A", "R",
    ##    "3", etc.)
    ##  - For non-alphanumeric characters, Unicode:ish names are used (e.g.
    ##    "COMMA", "LEFT_SQUARE_BRACKET", etc.). Note that some names do not
    ##    correspond to the Unicode standard (usually for brevity)
    ##  - Keys that lack a clear US mapping are named "WORLD_x"
    ##  - For non-printable keys, custom names are used (e.g. "F4",
    ##    "BACKSPACE", etc.)

proc glfwInit*(): bool {.importc: "glfwInit".}
  ## @brief Initializes the GLFW library.
  ##
  ## This function initializes the GLFW library.  Before most GLFW functions can
  ## be used, GLFW must be initialized, and before an application terminates GLFW
  ## should be terminated in order to free any resources allocated during or
  ## after initialization.
  ##
  ## If this function fails, it calls  glfwTerminate before returning.  If it
  ## succeeds, you should call  glfwTerminate before the application exits.
  ##
  ## Additional calls to this function after successful initialization but before
  ## termination will return `GLFW_TRUE` immediately.
  ##
  ## @return `GLFW_TRUE` if successful, or `GLFW_FALSE` if an
  ## error occurred.
  ##
  ## @errors Possible errors include  GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.
  ##
  ## @remark @macos This function will change the current directory of the
  ## application to the `Contents/Resources` subdirectory of the application's
  ## bundle, if present.  This can be disabled with the 
  ## GLFW_COCOA_CHDIR_RESOURCES init hint.
  ##
  ## @remark @macos This function will create the main menu and dock icon for the
  ## application.  If GLFW finds a `MainMenu.nib` it is loaded and assumed to
  ## contain a menu bar.  Otherwise a minimal menu bar is created manually with
  ## common commands like Hide, Quit and About.  The About entry opens a minimal
  ## about dialog with information from the application's bundle.  The menu bar
  ## and dock icon can be disabled entirely with the  GLFW_COCOA_MENUBAR init
  ## hint.
  ##
  ## @remark @x11 This function will set the `LC_CTYPE` category of the

  ## This function returns the size, in millimetres, of the display area of the

  ##
  ## Some systems do not provide accurate monitor size information, either
  ## because the monitor
  ## [EDID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_display_identification_data)
  ## data is incorrect or because the driver does not report it accurately.
  ##
  ## Any or all of the size arguments may be `NULL`.  If an error occurs, all
  ## non-`NULL` size arguments will be set to zero.

  ## @brief Creates a window and its associated context.
  ##
  ## This function creates a window and its associated OpenGL or OpenGL ES
  ## context.  Most of the options controlling how the window and its context
  ## should be created are specified with window hints.
  ##
  ## Successful creation does not change which context is current.  Before you
  ## can use the newly created context, you need to
  ## make it current.  For information about the `share`
  ## parameter, see  context_sharing.
  ##
  ## The created window, framebuffer and context may differ from what you
  ## requested, as not all parameters and hints are
  ## hard constraints.  This includes the size of the
  ## window, especially for full screen windows.  To query the actual attributes
  ## of the created window, framebuffer and context, see 
  ## glfwGetWindowAttrib,  glfwGetWindowSize and  glfwGetFramebufferSize.
  ##
  ## To create a full screen window, you need to specify the monitor the window
  ## will cover.  If no monitor is specified, the window will be windowed mode.
  ## Unless you have a way for the user to choose a specific monitor, it is
  ## recommended that you pick the primary monitor.  For more information on how
  ## to query connected monitors, see  monitor_monitors.
  ##
  ## For full screen windows, the specified size becomes the resolution of the
  ## window's _desired video mode_.  As long as a full screen window is not
  ## iconified, the supported video mode most closely matching the desired video
  ## mode is set for the specified monitor.  For more information about full
  ## screen windows, including the creation of so called _windowed full screen_
  ## or _borderless full screen_ windows, see  window_windowed_full_screen.
  ##
  ## Once you have created the window, you can switch it between windowed and
  ## full screen mode with  glfwSetWindowMonitor.  This will not affect its
  ## OpenGL or OpenGL ES context.
  ##
  ## By default, newly created windows use the placement recommended by the
  ## window system.  To create the window at a specific position, make it
  ## initially invisible using the GLFW_VISIBLE window
  ## hint, set its position and then show(@ref window_hide
  ## it.
  ##
  ## As long as at least one full screen window is not iconified, the screensaver
  ## is prohibited from starting.
  ##
  ## Window systems put limits on window sizes.  Very large or very small window
  ## dimensions may be overridden by the window system on creation.  Check the
  ## actual size after creation.
  ##
  ## The swap interval is not set during window creation and
  ## the initial value may vary depending on driver settings and defaults.
  ##
  ## @param[in] width The desired width, in screen coordinates, of the window.
  ## This must be greater than zero.
  ## @param[in] height The desired height, in screen coordinates, of the window.
  ## This must be greater than zero.
  ## @param[in] title The initial, UTF-8 encoded window title.
  ## @param[in] monitor The monitor to use for full screen mode, or `NULL` for
  ## windowed mode.
  ## @param[in] share The window whose context to share resources with, or `NULL`
  ## to not share resources.
  ## @return The handle of the created window, or `NULL` if an
  ## error occurred.
  ##
  ## @errors Possible errors include  GLFW_NOT_INITIALIZED, 
  ## GLFW_INVALID_ENUM,  GLFW_INVALID_VALUE,  GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE, 
  ## GLFW_VERSION_UNAVAILABLE,  GLFW_FORMAT_UNAVAILABLE and 
  ## GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR.
  ##
  ## @remark @win32 Window creation will fail if the Microsoft GDI software
  ## OpenGL implementation is the only one available.
  ##
  ## @remark @win32 If the executable has an icon resource named `GLFW_ICON,` it
  ## will be set as the initial icon for the window.  If no such icon is present,
  ## the `IDI_APPLICATION` icon will be used instead.  To set a different icon,
  ## see  glfwSetWindowIcon.
  ##
  ## @remark @win32 The context to share resources with must not be current on
  ## any other thread.
  ##
  ## @remark @macos The OS only supports core profile contexts for OpenGL
  ## versions 3.2 and later.  Before creating an OpenGL context of version 3.2 or
  ## later you must set the GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE
  ## hint accordingly.  OpenGL 3.0 and 3.1 contexts are not supported at all
  ## on macOS.
  ##
  ## @remark @macos The GLFW window has no icon, as it is not a document
  ## window, but the dock icon will be the same as the application bundle's icon.
  ## For more information on bundles, see the
  ## [Bundle Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/)
  ## in the Mac Developer Library.
  ##
  ## @remark @macos On OS X 10.10 and later the window frame will not be rendered
  ## at full resolution on Retina displays unless the
  ## GLFW_COCOA_RETINA_FRAMEBUFFER
  ## hint is `GLFW_TRUE` and the `NSHighResolutionCapable` key is enabled in the
  ## application bundle's `Info.plist`.  For more information, see
  ## [High Resolution Guidelines for OS X](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Explained/Explained.html)
  ## in the Mac Developer Library.  The GLFW test and example programs use
  ## a custom `Info.plist` template for this, which can be found as
  ## `CMake/Info.plist.in` in the source tree.
  ##
  ## @remark @macos When activating frame autosaving with
  ## GLFW_COCOA_FRAME_NAME, the specified
  ## window size and position may be overridden by previously saved values.
  ##
  ## @remark @x11 Some window managers will not respect the placement of
  ## initially hidden windows.
  ##
  ## @remark @x11 Due to the asynchronous nature of X11, it may take a moment for
  ## a window to reach its requested state.  This means you may not be able to
  ## query the final size, position or other attributes directly after window
  ## creation.
  ##
  ## @remark @x11 The class part of the `WM_CLASS` window property will by
  ## default be set to the window title passed to this function.  The instance
  ## part will use the contents of the `RESOURCE_NAME` environment variable, if
  ## present and not empty, or fall back to the window title.  Set the
  ## GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME and
  ## GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME window hints to
  ## override this.
  ##
  ## @remark @wayland Compositors should implement the xdg-decoration protocol
  ## for GLFW to decorate the window properly.  If this protocol isn't
  ## supported, or if the compositor prefers client-side decorations, a very
  ## simple fallback frame will be drawn using the wp_viewporter protocol.  A
  ## compositor can still emit close, maximize or fullscreen events, using for
  ## instance a keybind mechanism.  If neither of these protocols is supported,
  ## the window won't be decorated.
  ##
  ## @remark @wayland A full screen window will not attempt to change the mode,
  ## no matter what the requested size or refresh rate.
  ##
  ## @remark @wayland Screensaver inhibition requires the idle-inhibit protocol
  ## to be implemented in the user's compositor.
